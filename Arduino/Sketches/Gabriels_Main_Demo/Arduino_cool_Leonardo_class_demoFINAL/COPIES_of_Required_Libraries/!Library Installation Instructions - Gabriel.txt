Copy and paste these folders into your "libraries" folder inside your main Arduino Sketch directory.  

Find this directory by going to "File" --> "Preferences" in the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  
-Here, you will see your "Sketchbook location."  
--That's where you will find your "libraries" folder.
