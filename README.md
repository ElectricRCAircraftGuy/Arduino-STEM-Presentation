# Arduino-STEM-Presentation
An in-depth half-day public presentation and workshop I presented to a bunch of teachers in Dayton, Ohio in 2014 while working in the MAVLab (**Micro Air Vehicles Indoor Flight Laboratory**) for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The goal was to help teachers learn, get excited about, and be able to teach STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) to their students. 

I really enjoyed giving this presentation, and I highly recommend you check out and watch this video here to check out some of my truly exciting research I got to do while working there!

Formerly named and distributed as a single zip file named "Arduino STEM DVD - 20140623.zip".  

_Added to GitHub on 14 June 2020 to make distribution easier, since I still think the information is valuable and pertinent to teachers, students, engineers, and researchers today, and I'd like to make it easier to share what I've put together here._
