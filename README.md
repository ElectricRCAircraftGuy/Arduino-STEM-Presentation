# Arduino-STEM-Presentation
An in-depth half-day presentation and workshop I presented to a bunch of teachers in Dayton, Ohio in 2014 while working for the Air Force Research Laboratory.

Formerly named and distributed as a single zip file named "Arduino STEM DVD - 20140623.zip".  

_Added to GitHub on 14 June 2020 to make distribution easier, since I still think the information is valuable and pertinent to today, and I'd like to make it easier to share what I've put together here._
